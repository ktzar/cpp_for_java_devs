## <a name="overview">Overview</a>


Every class that has a **pointer** data member should include the following member functions:

1.  a destructor,
2.  a copy constructor,
3.  operator= (assignment)

The _IntList_ class, defined in the "Introduction to C++ Classes" notes, includes a pointer to a dynamically allocated array. Here is the declaration of the _IntList_ class again, augmented to include declarations of the class's destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator (in red for emphasis):

<pre>class IntList {
  public:
    IntList();                         // constructor; initialize the list to
                                       // be empty
    <font color="red">~IntList();                            // destructor
    IntList(const IntList &L);             // copy constructor
    IntList & operator=(const IntList &L); // assignment</font>
    void AddToEnd(int k);              // add k to the end of the list
    void Print(ostream &output) const; // print the list to output

  private:
    static const int SIZE = 10;      // initial size of the array
    int *Items;                      // Items will point to the dynamically
                                     // allocated array
    int numItems;                    // number of items currently in the list
    int arraySize;                   // the current size of the array
};
</pre>

## Destructor Functions

An object's destructor function is called when that object is about to "go away"; i.e., when:

1.  a class object (a value parameter or a local variable) goes out of scope, or
2.  a pointer to a class object is deleted (the dynamically allocated storage pointed to by the pointer is freed by the programmer using the **delete** operator)

The main purpose of the destructor function is to free any dynamically allocated storage pointed to _only_ by a data member of that object. (Note that it is up to the programmer to ensure that no other pointers are pointing to that storage.)

For example, consider the following function, with line numbers included for reference:

<pre>[1]  void f(IntList L) {
[2]    IntList *p = new IntList;
[3]    while (...) {
[4]      IntList L1;
[5]      ...
[6]    }
[7]    delete p;
[8]  }
</pre>

In this example, the scope of value parameter _L_ is the whole function; _L_ goes out of scope at the end of the function (line 8). So when function _f_ ends, _L_'s destructor function is called. (Note: if _f_ had one or more **return** statements, _L_'s destructor function would be called when a **return** was executed).

The scope of variable _L1_ is the body of the while loop (lines 4 to 6). _L1_'s constructor function is called at the beginning of every iteration of the loop, and its destructor function is called at the end of every iteration of the loop. Note that if the loop included a **break** or **continue** statement, the destructor would still be called.

Variable _p_ is a pointer to an _IntList_. When an _IntList_ object is allocated using **new** at line 2, that object's constructor function is called. When the storage is freed at line 7, the object's destructor function is called (and then the memory for the _Intlist_ itself is freed).

Why isn't the destructor function of a **reference** parameter called at the end of the function?

[solution](#ans1)

Destructor functions are defined using syntax similar to that used for the constructor function (the name of the class followed by a double colon followed by the name of the function). For example, the definition of the _Intlist_ destructor function would look like this:

<pre>IntList::~IntList() {
  delete [] Items; // free the dynamically allocated array pointed to by Items
}
</pre>

NOTE: If you don't write a destructor function for a class that includes pointers to dynamically allocated storage, your code will still work, but you will probably have some storage leaks.

To understand more about storage management and destructor functions, let's consider a simpler version of the example code given above:

<pre>[1]  void f() {
[2]    IntList *p = new IntList;
[3]      ...
[4]    delete p;
[5]  }
</pre>

Assume that just before line 4, we have the following situation:

<pre>p: ---------> +---------------+
              |               |    +---+
              | Items: ----------> | 2 |
              |               |    |---|
              | numItems: 10  |    | 6 |
              |               |    |---|
              | arraySize: 10 |    | . |
              |               |    | . |
              +---------------+    | . |
                                   +---+
</pre>

If there is no _IntList_ destructor, then when _delete p_ is executed, the storage for the _IntList_ object pointed to by _p_ (which was allocated at line 2) is freed. However, the array pointed to by the _IntList_'s _Items_ field is _not_ freed, and will never be freed, so that is a storage leak. If the _IntList_ destructor given above (that deletes the array pointed to by _Items_) is provided, then it is called when line 4 is executed. That call frees the array storage, and then the **delete** operator frees the storage pointed to by _p_ (namely, the storage for the _IntList_ itself), and there is no storage leak.

<a name="copyCons"></a>

## <a name="copyCons">Copy Constructor Functions</a>

An object's **copy constructor** is called (automatically, not by the programmer) when it is created, and needs to be initialized to be a _copy_ of an existing object. This happens when an object is:

1.  passed as a value parameter to a function,
2.  returned (by value) as a function result,
3.  declared with initialization from an existing object of the same class.

The purpose of the copy constructor is to make a copy of the

1.  actual parameter,
2.  value being returned,
3.  existing object.

* * *

### <u>Example</u>

<pre>[1]   IntList f( IntList L );
[2] 
[3]   int main() {
[4]     IntList L1, L2;
[5]     ...
[6]     L2 = f( L1 );           // copy constructor called here to copy L1
[7]   }
[8] 
[9]   IntList f( IntList L ) {
[10]    IntList tmp1 = L;       // copy constructor called here to copy L
[11]    IntList tmp2(L);        // copy constructor called here to copy L
[12]    ...
[13]    return tmp1;            // copy constructor called here to copy tmp1
[14]  }
</pre>

On line 6, variable _L1_ is passed as a value parameter to function _f_. The corresponding formal parameter is _L_. When the call is executed, _L_'s copy constructor is called to initialize _L_ to be a copy of the actual parameter, _L1_.

On line 10, variable _tmp1_ is declared to be an _IntList_, initialized to be the same as variable _L_. When line 10 is executed, _tmp1_'s copy constructor is called to initialize _tmp1_ to be a copy of _L_. Similarly, when line 11 is executed, _tmp2_'s copy constructor is called to initialize _tmp2_ to be a copy of _L_.

On line 13, variable _tmp1_ is returned as the result of calling function _f_. When line 13 is executed, a copy constructor is called to make a copy of _tmp1_ to be returned. (Later, that copy is used as the right-hand side of the assignment on line 6.)

* * *

If you don't write a copy constructor, the compiler will provide one that just copies the value of each data member (this is sometimes called a **shallow** copy). If some data member is a _pointer_, this causes _aliasing_ (both the original pointer and the copy point to the same location), and may lead to trouble. For example, consider the following code:

<pre>void f(IntList L) {
  L.AddToEnd(11);
}

int main() {
  IntList I;

  for (int k=1; k < 11; k++) I.AddToEnd(k);

  // I's array "Items" is now full
  f(I);
  ...
}
</pre>

If the _IntList_ class does not include a copy constructor, the compiler will supply one that just copies the value of the pointer _Items_. Here are pictures illustrating the result of the call to _I_'s copy constructor, which initializes the formal parameter _L_ to be a copy of _I_. Note that both _I.Items_ and _L.Items_ point to the same array.

<pre>   +---------------+
   |               |     +----+
I: | Items: -----------> |  1 |
   |               | +-> |----|
   |               | |   |  2 |
   | numItems: 10  | |   |----|
   |               | |   |  3 |
   | arraySize: 10 | |   |----|
   +---------------+ |   |  . |
                     |   |  . |
   +---------------+ |   |  . |
   |               | |   |----|
L: | Items: ---------+   | 10 |
   |               |     +----+
   |               |
   | numItems: 10  |
   |               |
   | arraySize: 10 |
   +---------------+  
</pre>

Now think about what happens when the body of function _f_ executes. _L.AddToEnd_ discovers that the array is full, so it allocates a new array, copies the values from the old array to the new array, and returns the old array to free storage. Unfortunately, _L.AddToEnd_ doesn't know that _I.Items_ is also pointing to the old array, so when that array is returned to free storage, _I.Items_ becomes a **dangling pointer**, and any attempt to access the array it points to is likely to lead to trouble.

Consider the _StrList_ class defined below. A _StrList_ stores a list of strings in a linked list pointed to by the _StrList_'s _head_ field. The _Lookup_ operation determines whether a given string is in the list; if it is there, it is moved to the front of the list, and the value _true_ is returned (otherwise, the list is unchanged, and the value _false_ is returned).

<pre>class StrList {
  public:
    // constructor
    StrList();

    // modifiers
    void AddToFront(string s);
    bool Lookup(string s);

    // other operations
    void Print(ostream &output) const;

  private:
    struct ListNode {
       string data;
       ListNode *next;
    };

    // pointer to the first node of the list
    ListNode *head;
};
</pre>

Consider the following code:

<pre>void f(StrList L) {
  L.Lookup("b");
}

int main() {
  StrList S;

  S.AddToFront("c"); S.AddToFront("b"); S.AddToFront("a");
  // S.head points to the linked list:
  //     "a" -> "b" -> "c"
  f(S);
  ...
}
</pre>

Note that there is no _StrList_ copy constructor (so the compiler will supply one). Draw variables _S_ and _L_ as they would appear at the very beginning of function _f_ (just after _L_'s copy constructor is called to initialize it to be a copy of _S_). Draw a second picture to illustrate what happens as a result of the call to _L.Lookup_ in function _f_. What goes wrong because there is no _StrList_ copy constructor?

### <a name="ccDecl">**The Copy Constructor Declaration**</a>

<a name="ccDecl">

Recall that the declaration of a class's copy constructor is similar to that of its default (no-argument) constructor: the function has no return type (not even _void_), and its name is the same as the name of the class. However, unlike the default constructor, the copy constructor has one argument: its type is the class, and it is a _const reference_ parameter. The argument is the object that the copy constructor is supposed to copy. For example:

<pre>class IntList {
  public:
    IntList();                 // default constructor
    IntList(const IntList &L)  // copy constructor
  ...
};
</pre>

</a>

<a name="ccDecl"></a><a name="ccDef"></a>

### <a name="ccDef">**The Copy Constructor Definition**</a>

<a name="ccDef">

The definition of the copy constructor (the actual code for the function) should be put in a ".C" file, along with the code for the other class member functions. The copy constructor should copy the values of all non-pointer data members, and should copy the objects pointed to by all pointer data members (this is sometimes called a **deep** copy). For example, the copy constructor for the _IntList_ class should perform the following tasks:

</a>


1.  allocate a new array of ints of size _L.arraySize_ (_L_ is the copy constructor's _IntList_ parameter); set _Items_ to point to the new array;
2.  copy the values in the array pointed to by _L.Items_ to the new array;
3.  initialize the _numItems_ and _arraySize_ fields to have the same values as the ones in _L.numItems_ and _L.arraySize_.

Here is the code for the _IntList_ copy constructor (note that, like the other constructor functions, the copy constructor can use a member initialization list to initialize data members, as well as using code in the body of the function):

<pre>IntList::IntList(const IntList & L): Items(new int[L.arraySize]),
                                     numItems(L.numItems),
                                     arraySize(L.arraySize)
                                     {
  for (int k=0; k < numItems; k++) {
    Items[k] = L.Items[k];
  }
}
</pre>

<a name="assign"></a>

## <a name="assign">Operator=</a>

In C++ you can assign from one class object to another (of the same type). For example:

<pre>IntList L1, L2;
...
L1 = L2;  // this assignment is OK
</pre>

By default, class assignment is just field-by-field assignment (i.e., a **shallow** copy is done). For example, the above assignment is equivalent to:

<pre>L1.Items = L2.Items;
L1.numItems = L2.numItems;
L1.arraySize = L2.arraySize;
</pre>

(Of course, the three field assignments could not be written outside an _IntList_ member function, since they are private fields; however, they illustrate the effect of the assignment _L1 = L2_.)

If a class includes pointer fields, the default class assignment causes aliasing, and as we have seen in the case of the copy constructor, this can lead to trouble! For example, if the _L2.Items_ array is full when the assignment is done, then a subsequent call to _L1.AddToFront_ will cause the array to be returned to free storage (so _L2.Items_ will become a dangling pointer).

The default assignment can also cause storage leaks when the class has a pointer field. For example, when _L1 = L2;_ is executed, _L1.Items_ is simply overwritten with the value in _L2.Items_, the array that _L1_ was pointing to is not returned to free storage (and that storage is now lost).

To prevent these problems, you should always define **operator=** as a class member function for a class with a pointer field, and you should define operator= to do a **deep** copy. The declaration of the member function looks like this for the IntList class:

<pre>IntList & operator=(const IntList &L);
</pre>

The idea is that when the assignment _L1 = L2;_ is executed, _L1_'s member function _operator=_ is called, and _L2_ is passed as the argument to that function.

Note that _IntList_'s operator= function returns an _IntList_. This is to permit **chained assignment**, for example: _L1 = L2 = L3;_. When this statement is executed, the expression _L2 = L3_ is evaluated first; the result of evaluating that expression is used as the right-hand side of the assignment to _L1_. The operator= function returns its result by **reference** (that's what the ampersand means). This is done for efficiency, to prevent the _IntList_ copy constructor being called to make a copy of the returned value.

Note that operator= differs from the copy constructor in three important ways:

1.  The object being assigned to has already been initialized; therefore, if it has a pointer field, the storage pointed to must be freed to prevent a storage leak.
2.  It is possible for a programmer to assign from a variable into _itself_; for example: _L1 = L1_. The operator= code must check for this case, and do nothing.
3.  The operator= code must return a value.

Here is the definition of operator= for the IntList class:

<pre>IntList & IntList::operator=(const IntList &L) {
  // check for "self assignment" and do nothing in that case
  if (this == &L) return *this;
  else {
    delete [] Items;                // free the storage pointed to by Items
    Items = new int[L.arraySize];   // allocate a new array
    arraySize = L.arraySize;        // set the arraySize field

    // copy the items from L's array to the new array
    // also sets the numItems field
    for (numItems=0; numItems < L.numItems; numItems++) {
      Items[numItems] = L.Items[numItems];
    }

    return *this;                   // return this IntList

}
</pre>

Note that, as in Java, every member function has access to a variable named _this_ that is a pointer to the object whose member function was called. So for example, when _L1 = L2;_ is executed, _L1_'s member function _operator=_ is called, so _this_ is a pointer to _L1_.

To check whether the assignment was _L1 = L1_, we compare the pointer _this_ with the address of the parameter, _L_; in the case of _L1 = L1_, the parameter is _L1_, so its address is the same as the address that is the value of _this_. Be sure to include this test every time you write an operator= function!

We also make use of <em>this</em> for the returned value;
the type to be returned is <em>IntList</em> (not pointer to <em>IntList</em>)
so we return <em>*this</em> (the <em>IntList</em> pointed to by <em>this</em>)
rather than plain <em>this</em>.


<p>
<a name="wrap">
<H2>Wrap-up</H2></a>
<p>
Every class that has a <b>pointer</b> data member should include the
following member functions:
<OL>
  <LI> a destructor,
  <LI> a copy constructor,
  <LI> operator= (assignment)
</OL>

If you don't write a destructor, your code will probably still work, but
it may have storage leaks (some uses of the <b>new</b> operator will have
no corresponding use of <b>delete</b>).


If you don't write a copy constructor, or you don't write operator=,
your code may <em>not</em> work correctly; there may be attempts to dereference
dangling pointers (which may cause runtime errors, or may cause garbage
values to be assigned to some variables), and/or some data may be
lost or corrupted.

A kind of compromise is to **forbid** the use of the copy constructor and the assignment of two class objects. You can do this by declaring the copy constructor and operator= as **private** member functions (just declaring them is enough; you do not need to write the actual code). In this case, any code that would normally cause the copy constructor or operator= to be called will instead cause a compile-time error.

### <a name="ans1">Test Yourself #1</a>

A reference parameter's destructor function is not called at the end of the function because the corresponding actual parameter refers to the same object. The object does not "go away" when the function ends, so its dynamically allocated storage should not be freed.
### <a name="ans2">Test Yourself #2</a>

Here are actual parameter _S_ and formal parameter _L_ at the beginning of function _f_:

<pre>   +-------------+
   |       +---+ |   +---------+  +---------+  +---------+
S: | head: | ------->| "a" | ---->| "b" | ---->| "c" | \ |
   |       +---+ |   +---------+  +---------+  +---------+
   +-------------+   ^
                     |
   +-------------+   |
   |       +---+ |   |
L: | head: | --------+
   |       +---+ |
   +-------------+

</pre>

And here are _S_ and _L_ just after the call to _Lookup_ in function _f_:

<pre>   +-------------+
   |       +---+ |   +---------+  +---------+
S: | head: | ------->| "a" | ---->| "c" | \ |
   |       +---+ |   +---------+  +---------+
   +-------------+   ^
                     |
   +-------------+   +-----------+
   |       +---+ |   +---------+ |
L: | head: | ------->| "b" | ----+
   |       +---+ |   +---------+
   +-------------+

</pre>

Because the _StrList_ class has no copy constructor, the _head_ fields of both _S_ and _L_ point to the same linked-list. The call to _Lookup_ changes that list (by moving the node that contains "b" to the front of the list); it also changes the _head_ field of _L_ to point to the node that was moved. However, it doesn't know anything about _S_, so _S_'s _head_ field still points to the node that contains "a" (and the node that contains "b" has effectively been removed from the list represented by _S_).
