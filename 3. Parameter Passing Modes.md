## Overview

</a>

In Java, all parameters are passed by value. In C++, a parameter can be passed by:

1.  value,
2.  reference, or
3.  const-reference

Each parameter's mode is determined by the way it is specified in the function's header (the mode is the same for all calls to the function). For example:

<pre>void f( int a, int &b, const int &c );
</pre>

Parameter _a_ is a value parameter, _b_ is a reference parameter, and _c_ is a const-reference parameter.

<a name="value"></a>

## <a name="value">Value Parameters</a>

When a parameter is passed by value, a _copy_ of the parameter is made. Therefore, changes made to the formal parameter by the called function have no effect on the corresponding actual parameter. For example:

<pre>void f(int n) {
    n++;
}

int main() {
    int x = 2;
    f(x);
    cout << x;  
}
</pre>

In this example, _f's_ parameter is passed by value. Therefore, although _f_ increments its formal parameter _n_, that has no effect on the actual parameter _x_. The value output by the program is 2 (not 3).

Note that if a _pointer_ is passed by value, then although the pointer itself is not affected by changes made to the corresponding formal parameter, the object pointed by the pointed _can_ be changed. For example:

<pre>void f(int *p) {
    *p = 5;
    p = NULL;
}

int main() {
    int x=2;
    int *q = &x;

    f(q);

    // here, x == 5, but q != NULL
}
</pre>

In this example, _f's_ parameter is passed by value. Therefore, the assignment _p = NULL;_ in _f_ has no effect on variable _q_ in main (since _f_ was passed a copy of _q_, not _q_ itself). However, the assignment _*p = 5:_ in _f_, **does** change the value pointed to by _q_. To understand why, consider what happens when the example program runs:

<pre>After executing the two statements:
    int x=2;
    int *q = &x;

memory looks like this:

       +---+
    x: | 2 | <--+
       +---+    |
                |
       +---+    |
    q: | --|----+
       +---+

Now function f is called; the value of q (which is the address of x)
is copied into a new location named p:

       +---+
    x: | 2 | <--+  <--+
       +---+    |     |
                |     |
       +---+    |     |
    q: | --|----+     |
       +---+          |
                      |
       +---+          |
    p: | --|----------+
       +---+

Executing the two statements in f:
    *p = 5;
    p = NULL;

causes the values of x (the thing pointed to by p) and p to be changed:

       +---+
    x: | 5 | <--+
       +---+    |
                |
       +---+    |
    q: | --|----+
       +---+     

       +----+     
    p: |NULL|
       +----+

However, note that q is NOT affected.

## Reference Parameters

</a>

When a parameter is passed by reference, conceptually, the actual parameter itself is passed (and just given a new name -- the name of the corresponding formal parameter). Therefore, any changes made to the formal parameter _do_ affect the actual parameter. For example:

<pre>void f(int &n) {
    n++;
}

int main() {
    int x = 2;
    f(x);
    cout << x;  
}
</pre>

In this example, _f's_ parameter is passed by reference. Therefore, the assignment to _n_ in _f_ is actually changing variable _x_, so the output of this program is 3.

When you write a function whose purpose is to compute two or more values, it makes sense to use reference parameters (since a function can _return_ only one result). For example, if you want to read a list of integers from a file, and you want to know both how many integers were read, as well as the average value that was read, you might use a function like the following:

<pre>void f(istream &input, int &numRead, double &average) {
    int k, sum = 0;
    numRead = 0;

    while (intput >> k) {
        numRead++;
	sum += k;
    }
    average = (double)sum/numRead;
}
</pre>

Another common use of reference parameters is for a function that swaps two values:

<pre>void swap( int &j, int &k ) {
    int tmp = j;
    j = k;
    j = tmp;
}
</pre>

This is useful, for example, in sorting an array, when it is often necessary to swap two array elements. The following code swaps the _j_<sup>th</sup> and _k_<sup>th</sup> elements of array _A_:

<pre>swap(A[j], A[k]);
</pre>

<a name="constRef">

## Const-Reference Parameters

</a>

Another reason to use reference parameters is when you don't want the function to modify an actual parameter, but the actual parameter is very large, and you want to avoid the overhead of creating a copy. Of course, this only works if the function does not modify its formal parameter. To be sure that the actual parameter is not "accidentally" modified, you should use a **const-reference** parameter. Declaring the parameter to be _const_ tells the compiler that it should not be changed; if the function does change the parameter, you will get a compile-time warning (possibly an error on some systems). For example:

<pre>void f(const IntList &L) {
 -- the code here cannot modify L or the compiler will complain --
}
</pre>

The potential use of a const-reference parameter is the reason why member functions that do not modify any data members should be declared _const_. For example, suppose that the _IntList_ _Print_ member function was not declared const. Then the following code would cause a compile-time error:

<pre>void f(const IntList &L) {
  L.Print(cout);
}
</pre>

Because _L_ is a const-reference parameter, it is the compiler's job to be sure that _L_ is not modified by _f_ (and that means that no data members of _L_ are modified). The compiler doesn't know how the _Print_ function is implemented; it only knows how it was declared, so if it is not declared const, it assumes the worst, and complains that function _f_ modifies its const-reference parameter _L_.<a name="array">

## Array Parameters

</a>

Another unfortunate thing about C++ arrays is that they are _always_ passed by reference (even though you don't declare them to be reference parameters). For example:

<pre>void f(int A[]) {
    A[0] = 5;
}

int main() {
    int B[10];
    B[0] = 2;
    f(B);
    cout << B[0] << endl;  // the output is 5
}
</pre>

Although _f's_ parameter looks like it is passed by value (there is no &), since it is an array it is actually passed by reference, so the assignment to _A[0]_ is really assigning to _B[0]_, and the program prints 5 (not 2).

If you want to pass an array by value, you should use a **vector**, not a regular C++ array (see the last section in the notes on C++ classes for information about vectors).

1.  Consider the following code segment.

    <pre>void Mystery( int & a, int & b, int c )
    {
         a = b + c;
         b = 0;
         c = 0;
    }

    void Print()
    {
         int x = 0, y = 1, z = 2;

         Mystery(x, y, z);
         cout << x << " " << y << " " << z;
         Mystery(x, y, z);
         cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;
    }
    </pre>

    What is output when function _Print_ is called?

    A. 0 1 2 0 1 2   
    B. 3 0 0 3 0 0   
    C. 0 1 2 3 0 0   
    D. 3 0 2 2 0 2   
    E. 3 0 0 0 0 0

2.  A function called _Sqrt_, which is intended to compute and return the square root of its integer parameter, has been written. When the function is tested, it is observed that, although the correct value is returned, the argument passed to _Sqrt_ is always zero after the function call. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this problem?

    A. _Sqrt_ is written using recursion; it should be written using iteration.   
    B. _Sqrt_ is written using iteration; it should be written using recursion.   
    C. _Sqrt_'s parameter is a value parameter; it should be a reference parameter.   
    D. _Sqrt_'s parameter is a reference parameter; it should be a value parameter.   
    E. _Sqrt_'s parameter is a const reference parameter; it should be a value parameter.

3.  Consider the following program.

    <pre>#include <iostream>

    void Sum(int a, int b, int & c)
    {
         a = b + c;
         b = a + c;
         c = a + b;
    }

    int main()
    {
         int x=2, y=3;

         Sum(x, y, y);
         cout << x << " " << y << endl;
         return 0;
    }
    </pre>

    What happens when this program is compiled and executed?

    A. There is a compile-time error because in the call _Sum(x, y, y)_, variable _y_ is passed both by value and by reference.   
    B. There is a run-time error because in the call _Sum(x, y, y)_, variable _y_ is passed both by value and by reference.   
    C. The program compiles and executes without error. The output is: 2 3   
    D. The program compiles and executes without error. The output is: 6 9   
    E. The program compiles and executes without error. The output is: 2 15

    Questions 4 and 5 refer to the following function.

    <pre>bool Mystery(const vector <int> & A)
    // precondition: A is sorted
    {
         int k;

         for (k=1; k<A.size(); k++)
         {
           /Users/gonzlm01/playground/cpp_for_java_devs/3. Parameter Passing Modes.md   if (A[k-1] == A[k]) return true;
         }
         return false;
    }
    </pre>

4.  Which of the following best explains what function _Mystery_ does?

    A. Always returns true.   
    B. Always returns false.   
    C. Determines whether vector _A_ really is sorted.   
    D. Determines whether vector _A_ contains any duplicate values.   
    E. Determines whether all values in vector _A_ are the same.

5.  Which of the following best explains why _A_ is a reference parameter?

    A. _A_ may be modified by function _Mystery_; thus, it must be a reference parameter.   
    B. _A_ is indexed by function _Mystery_; thus, it must be a reference parameter.   
    C. _A_'s _size_ member function is used by function _Mystery_; thus, it must be a reference parameter.   
    D. It is more efficient to pass _A_ by reference than by value.   
    E. There is no reason for _A_ to be a reference parameter.
