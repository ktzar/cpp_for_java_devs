## An Example C++ Class

</a>

C++ classes are similar to Java classes in many ways, but there are also important differences. Below is an example of a C++ class named _IntList_ to be used to represent a list of integers; operations to add a value to the end of the list and to print the list are provided. The implementation uses a dynamically allocated array to store the integers; when the array is full, a new array of twice the size is allocated.

In Java, the class definition would all be in a single file. However, in C++ the code that defines the class would be split into two files: the first part specifies what **member functions** (methods) and **data members** (fields) the class will have. That code goes into a **header** file: a file with the extension ._h_. It is usually a good idea (though not a requirement as in Java) to give the file the same name as the class (so the file would be named _IntList.h_).

The second part of the class definition gives the code for the function bodies. That code goes in a source file (e.g., _IntList.C_).

The reason for splitting up the code is that it is generally a good idea to try to separate the **interface** from the **implementation**. Someone who wants to use an _IntList_ really only needs to know what _IntList_ operations are available; it is not necessary to know all the details about how an _IntList_ is implemented. However, splitting up the code in this way is not required by C++. Some people prefer to include code for the member functions in the _.h_ file when that code involves only one or two statements.

Here is the code that would be in _IntList.h_:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class IntList {
  public:
    IntList();                         // constructor; initialize the list to be empty
    void AddToEnd(int k);              // add k to the end of the list
    void Print(ostream &output) const; // print the list to output

  private:
    static const int SIZE = 10;      // initial size of the array
    int *Items;                      // Items will point to the dynamically allocated array
    int numItems;                    // number of items currently in the list
    int arraySize;                   // the current size of the array
};
```

Things to note about the example so far:

*   The class declaration must end with a semi-colon.
*   The public and private members are grouped (as opposed to Java, where each method and each field is declared either public or private). It is generally considered a good idea to put the public members first, but that is not a C++ requirement.
*   As in Java, the class's constructor function must have the same name as the class, and no return type (not even _void_).
*   Function _Print_ is declared to be a **const** function. In general, member functions that do not change any of the data members of the class should be declared _const_. The reason for this is that an IntList may be passed as a const-reference parameter. For example, suppose that the _IntList_ _Print_ member function was not declared const. Then the following code would cause a compile-time warning or error:

```cpp
void f(const IntList &L) {
       L.Print(cout);
    }
```

    Because _L_ is a const-reference parameter, it is the compiler's job to be sure that _L_ is not modified by _f_ (and that means that no data members of _L_ are modified). The compiler doesn't know how the _Print_ function is implemented; it only knows how it was declared, so if it is not declared const, it assumes the worst, and complains that function _f_ modifies its const-reference parameter _L_.
*   As in Java, a class can contain **static** data members. Every instance of the class will include its own copy of each of the non-static data members (e.g., each _IntList_ object will include its own _Items_ array, _numItems_ integer, and _arraySize_ integer), but there will be only one copy of each static data member for the whole class.
*   Only static data members can be initialized as part of the class declaration. Other data members are initialized by the class's constructor function(s).

Here is the code that would be in _IntList.C_ (the actual code for the _AddToEnd_ and _Print_ functions has been omitted):

```cpp
#include "IntList.h"

IntList::IntList(): Items(new int[SIZE]), numItems(0), arraySize(SIZE) {
}

void IntList::AddToEnd(int k) {
   ...
}

void IntList::Print(ostream &output) const {
   ...
}
```

Things to note about this part of the example:

*   It is important to include the corresponding _.h_ file; otherwise, you will get compile-time errors. In the _#include_, the name of the file is enclosed in quotes, not in angle brackets. Angle brackets are used for including standard library header files, and quotes are used for including your own header files (this tells the compiler where to look for the header file).
*   To tell the compiler that you are defining the member functions of the _IntList_ class, you must prefix each function name with: _IntList::_ (note that this prefix comes after the function's return type).
*   The definition of the _IntList_ constructor uses a **member initialization list** to initialize the three fields. This is equivalent to the following code:

```cpp
IntList::IntList() {
     Items = new int[SIZE];
     numItems = 0;
     arraySize = SIZE;
 }
```

    In general, a member initialization list consists of a list of data member names with their initial values in parentheses, separated by commas. The initial value does not have to be a constant; it can be any expression. It is OK to initialize some data members in the member initialization list, and to initialize others using code inside the body of the constructor function. The member initialization list is executed before the body of the function, so if you initialize a data member in the member initialization list, it will already have its initial value inside the body of the constructor function.

    The main reason to use a member initialization list is when a data member is itself a class object, and you don't want the default initialization of that object. If you initialize the data member inside the body of the constructor function it will already have been initialized using its default (no-arg) constructor, which is a waste of time.

<a name="constructor"></a>

## <a name="constructor">Constructor Functions</a>

<a name="constructor">

As in Java, constructor functions can be **overloaded** (there can be multiple constructors for a class, as long as each has a different number and/or type of parameters). In C++, a constructor function is called either when a class object is _declared_:

```cpp
IntList L;  // L's no-arg constructor function is called
```

or when the object is dynamically allocated:

```cpp
IntList *p;       // no constructor called yet
p = new IntList;  // now the no-arg constructor is called
```

To use a constructor with parameters, just put the values for the parameters in parentheses as follows:

```cpp
IntList L(1, 10);          // L's 2-arg constructor will be called
IntList *p;
p = new IntList(0, 5, 22); // L's 3-arg constructor will be called
```

1.  Extend the _IntList_ class defined above by adding a member function called _Length_. The function should return the number of items currently in the list. Write the new declaration that would be added to _IntList.h_ as well as the new code that would be added to _IntList.C_ (write the complete code for the new function , not just ... as in the example).
2.  Add a 2-argument constructor to the _IntList_ class to allow an _IntList_ to be initialized to contain _n_ copies of value _v_. (So the two arguments are _n_ and _v_, both of type _int_.) Again, write both the new declaration that would be added to _IntList.h_, and the new code that would be added to _IntList.C_.

## Two Useful Standard Classes: string and vector

</a>

<a name="builtin"></a><a name="string"></a>

### <a name="string">The string class</a>

To use the **string** class you must _#include <string>_ (be sure that you do not include _string.h_, because then you will get the header file for C-style strings rather than for the C++ string class).

*   A string variable can be declared with or without an initial value:

```cpp
string s1;             // s1 is initialized to the empty string
string s2("hello");    // s2 is initialized to the string "hello"
string s3 = "goodbye"; // s3 is initialized to the string "goodbye"
```

*   The string class provides a **size** function:

```cpp
string s1, s2 = "hello";
cout << s1.size();         // s1's size is 0
cout << s2.size();         // s2's size is 5
```

*   Two strings can be compared using ==

```cpp
string s1("abc");
string s2;
s2 = "abc";
if (s1 == s2) ...    // yes!  the two strings ARE equal
```

*   Strings can be concatenated using the + operator

```cpp
string s1("hello");
string s2("goodbye");
string s3 = s1 + " and " + s2;  // the value of s3 is "hello and goodbye"
```

*   The individual characters in strings can be accessed or updated using indexing (starting with 0), but you cannot index beyond the current length of the string.

```cpp
string s1 = "hello";
for (int k=s1.size()-1; k>=0; k--) cout << s1[k];  // write s1 backwards
for (int k=s1.size()-1; k>=0; k--) s1[k] = 'a';    // change s to "aaaaa"
s[10] = 'a';                                       // ERROR! s only has 5
                                                   // chars
```

More detailed documentation on strings is available: [click here](STRING.html).

<a name="vector"></a>

### <a name="vector">The vector class</a>

To use the **vector** class you must _#include <vector>_. A vector is similar to an array, but vectors provide some operations that cannot be performed using C++ arrays, and vectors can be passed both by value and by reference (unlike C++ arrays, which are always passed by reference). Unfortunately, there is no bounds checking for vectors (i.e., an index out of bounds does not necessarily cause a runtime error).

*   A vector variable is declared with the type of its elements and its size; for example:

```cpp
vector <int> v1(10);  // v1 is a vector of 10 integers
vector <char> v2(5);  // v2 is a vector of 5 characters
```

    The specified size can be any expression that evaluates to a non-negative integer value.
*   Use indexing to access the elements of a vector as you would for an array:

```cpp
vector <int> v(10);
for (int k=0; k < 10; k++) {
    v[k] = 3;
}
```

*   The vector class provides a **size** function:

```cpp
vector <int> v1(10);
vector <double> v2(5);
cout << v1.size();         // v1's size is 10
cout << v2.size();         // v2's size is 5
```

*   The vector class provides a **resize** function:

```cpp
vector <int> v(1);
v[0] = 10;
v.resize(2*v.size());
v[1] = 20;
v.resize(1);
```

    The resize operation preserves as many of the old values as possible (so in the example, after the first _resize_ operation, _v[0]_ is still 10; after the second _resize_ operation, _v[0]_ is still 10, but there is no element of _v_ equal to 20).
*   Two vectors can be compared using == (they are equal iff they have the same size, and corresponding values are the same).
*   One vector can be assigned to another using = (the types of the two vectors must be compatible; e.g., if the vectors are named _v1_ and _v2_, the assignment _v1 = v2_ is OK iff the assignment _v1[0] = v2[0]_ is OK). The size of the vector being assigned to doesn't matter; it is changed after the assignment to be the same as the size of the vector being assigned from (for example, if _v1.size()_ == 2, and _v2.size()_ == 10, the assignment _v1 = v2_ is fine -- after it is executed, _v1.size()_ == 10). Assigning from one vector to another does _not_ introduce aliasing; for example, after the assignment _v1 = v2_, changing an element of _v1_ has no effect on _v2_ (or vice versa).
*   A function can return a vector (a function cannot return a C++ array).

```cpp
vector <int> f( ) { ... }
```

*   A vector can be passed by value or by reference (a C++ array is always passed by reference).

```cpp
void f( vector <int> A );  // A is passed by value
void f( vector <int>&B ); // B is passed by reference</int> </int>
```

1.  Write a function named _NonEmpty_ that has one parameter, a vector of strings _V_, and that returns another vector of strings that contains just the non-empty strings in _V_. For example, if parameter _V_ contains the 6 strings:
    then function _NonEmpty_ should create and return a vector that contains the 3 strings:

2.  Write a function named _Expand_ that has one parameter, a vector of ints _V_. _Expand_ should change _V_ so that it is double its original size, and contains (in its first half) the values that were originally in _V_.

    Test your function with the following main function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  vector <int>v(1);

  for (int k = 1; k <= 16; k++) {
    if (v.size() < k) {
      cout << "vector size before calling Expand: " << v.size() << endl;
      Expand(v);
      cout << "vector size after calling Expand: " << v.size() << endl;
    }
    v[k-1] = k;
  }
  cout << "[ ";
  for (int k = 0; k < v.size(); k++) {
    cout << v[k] << ' ';
  }
  cout << "]\n";
  return 0;
}</int>
```

    When you run this program, the output should be:

```cpp
vector size before calling Expand: 1
    vector size after calling Expand: 2
    vector size before calling Expand: 2
    vector size after calling Expand: 4
    vector size before calling Expand: 4
    vector size after calling Expand: 8
    vector size before calling Expand: 8
    vector size after calling Expand: 16
    [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ]
```

### <a name="ans1">Test Yourself #1</a>

<u>Question 1:</u>

To extend the _IntList_ class to include member function _Length_, the following would be added to the public part of the class declaration (in the file _IntList.h_):

```cpp
int Length() const;
```

Note that _Length_ should be a **const** member function because it does not modify any fields.

The code for the _Length_ function (to be added to the file _IntList.C_) is:

```cpp
int IntList:: Length() const {
    return numItems;
}
```

<u>Question 2:</u>

To extend the _IntList_ class by adding a 2-argument constructor, the following would be added to the public part of the class declaration:

```cpp
IntList(int n, int v);
```

and the following would be added to _IntList.C_:

```cpp
IntList::IntList(int n, int v): Items(new int[SIZE]), numItems(0),
                                arraySize(SIZE) {
  for (int k=0; k < n; k++) AddToEnd(v);
}
```

Note that this version of the 2-argument constructor first initializes the list to be empty (by setting _numItems_ to zero), then uses the _AddToEnd_ function to add value _v_ to the list _n_ times. Of course, the code that stores _v_ in the _Items_ array could be included here instead of calling _AddToEnd_; however, it is usually better to call a function than to duplicate code.

<a name="ans2"></a>

### Test Yourself #2

<u>Question 1:</u>

```cpp
vector <string> NonEmpty(vector <string> V) {
  // count the number of non-empty strings in V
  int num = 0;
  for (int k=0; k < V.size(); k++) {
    if (V[k] != "") num++;
  }

  // declare a vector of the right size and fill it in
  vector <string> newV(num);
  int index = 0;
  for (int k=0; k < V.size(); k++) {
    if (V[k] != "") {
      newV[index] = V[k];
      index++;
    }
  }

  // return result
  return newV;
}
```

Note that this solution make two passes through vector _V_: the first pass counts the number of non-empty strings in vector _V_, and the second pass fills in the new vector _newV_ (after it has been declared to have the appropriate size). An alternative would be to start by defining _newV_ to have size 0, and make a single pass through vector _V_, resizing _newV_ by 1 each time another non-empty string is found in _V_. The problem with that approach is that resizing a vector from size _n_ to size _n+1_ probably takes time O(_n_) (to copy the values). (The actual time depends on the implementation of _resize_; a straightforward implementation that allocates exactly the amount of memory requested will be O(_n_).) Therefore, the alternative approach would be O(_n<sup>2</sup>_), while the solution given above is O(_n_), where _n_ is the number of non-empty strings in vector _V_.

<u>Question 2:</u>

```cpp
void Expand(vector <int> &V) {
  V.resize(2*V.size());
}
```

Note that it is crucial to make _Expand_'s parameter a **reference** parameter.
