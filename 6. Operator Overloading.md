## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

C++ allows almost all operators to be **overloaded** to apply to class objects. For example, the following code shows some operators (in red) being applied to objects of type _Intlist_:

```cpp
IntList L1, L2, L3;

L1 <font color="red">+=</font> 10;
L3 = L1 <font color="red">+</font> L2;
cout <font color="red"><<</font> L1;
if (L1<font color="red">[</font>0<font color="red">]</font> == 5) ...
if (L1 <font color="red">==</font> L2) ...
```


It is important to note that if you do **not** define these operators to apply to your class, you will get a compile-time error if you write code that does apply them to class objects; the compiler supplies a default version **only** for operator= (assignment).

Note also that when you overload operators, at least one operand must be a class object (or an enum). For example, you can redefine the plus operator applied to an _IntList_ and an integer, or to two _IntList_s, but you _cannot_ redefine plus applied to two integers. You also cannot redefine the arity of an operator; for example, you cannot define plus to have three operands.

Some operators are unary (have one operand), and some are binary (have two operands). The example given above includes only binary operators: +=, +, <<, [], and ==. Examples of unary operators are: unary minus, pre- and post-increment, and pre- and post-decrement.

Unary operators, and binary operators whose left operands are class objects, can be defined either as member functions of that class, or as free functions. Binary operators whose left operands are **not** class objects must be defined as free functions.

## <a name="ex1">Example: Overloading +=</a>

In the statement:

```cpp
L1 += 10;
```


the left operand of += is an _IntList_, and its right operand is an integer. Therefore, this version of += can be defined either as an _IntList_ member function or as a free function. Here is how it might be defined as a member function:

```cpp
class IntList {
  public:
    void operator+=( int n );
  ...
};

void IntList::operator+=( int n ) {
  AddToEnd( n );
}
```


Note that it is up to the designer of the class to decide what it means to apply an operator to a class object. This definition of operator+= adds the right-hand operand (the integer value) to the end of the list represented by the left-hand operand (the _IntList_ whose member function is called). It would also be reasonable to define operator+= to add the integer to the front of the list.

<a name="ex2"></a>

## <a name="ex2">Example: Overloading <<</a>

In the statement:

```cpp
cout << L1;
```


the left operand of << is an ostream, not an _IntList_. Therefore, operator<< cannot be defined as a member function of the _Intlist_ class; it must be defined as a free function. For example:

```cpp
ostream &operator<<( ostream &out, const IntList &L ) {
  L.Print(out);
  return out;
}
```


Note that operator<< should be defined to return an _ostream_ (so that "chained" output, like: <tt>cout << L1 << endl</tt> will work). (It is returned by reference -- that's what the & means -- for efficiency.) Also note that operator<<'s first parameter must be an _ostream_ passed by **reference**. Its second parameter, the _IntList_ that is printed, does not have to be passed as a const-reference parameter; however it is more efficient to pass it by reference than by value (since that avoids a call to the copy constructor), and it should not be modified by operator<<, so it should be a **const** reference parameter.

Note also that this code assumes that the _IntList_ class has a _Print_ function. If that is not true, then operator<< must be declared to be a **friend** function of the _IntList_ class, so that it has access to the private _Items_ and _numItems_ fields (which it needs in order to be able to print the contents of the list). In that case, the function would be declared like this:

```cpp
class IntList {
  <font color="red">friend ostream &operator<<( ostream &out, const IntList &L );</font>

  public:
  ...
};
```


and defined like this:

```cpp
ostream &operator<<( ostream &out, const IntList &L ) {
  out << "[ ";
  for (int k=0; k< L.numItems; k++) {
    out << L.Items[k] << ' ';
  }
  out << ']';
}
```

## Test Yourself Now

</a>

Define operator== first as an _IntList_ member function and then as a free function (in both cases, the function should return true iff both of the operands of == contain the same sequence of integer values).

### Test Yourself #1

Here is operator== as an _IntList_ member function:

```cpp
bool IntList::operator==(const IntList &L) const {
  // check lengths of lists
  if (numItems != L.numItems) return false;

  // check contents of lists
  for (int k=0; k < numItems; k++) {
    if (Items[k] != L.Items[k]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```


Note that, since the function does not modify any of the _IntList_'s fields, it is declared to be a **const** member function.

And here it is as a free function:

```cpp
bool operator==(const IntList &L1, const IntList &L2) {
  // check lengths of lists
  if (L1.numItems != L2.numItems) return false;

  // check contents of lists
  for (int k=0; k < L1.numItems; k++) {
    if (L1.Items[k] != L2.Items[k]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
